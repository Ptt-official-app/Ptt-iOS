# Goals

1. Make fluent user interface: built on [Texture](https://texturegroup.org)
2. Make compact main repository and app size
   - No other third party library unless there are strong reasons
   - Use [PaintCode Plugin for Sketch](https://www.paintcodeapp.com/sketch) for vector image assets
   - With Swift ABI Stability, app size is minimized since iOS 12.2 or later
3. Support iOS 9 or later, Dynamic Type, VoiceOver

# Coding Guidelines

- Please follow [commit message guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- We donâ€™t have Swift style guide yet. Follow UIKit style for now.
